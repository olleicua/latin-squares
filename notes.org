Metrics that we care about
- 2A + B + C
- A + B + D
- A + B + C + D + E
- D + E for the best 2A + B + C

Generating arrays:

search for r rows (r = 2 or 3) with the constraints that the
differences as calculated by (x1, y1) - (x2, y2) = (x1 - y1, x2, y2)
being unique in all r rows and that each column have one of each label

symmetry
- both squares can start with (0,0), (0,1), (0,2) as their first column
- the first square first row can have the same coprime constraint as the
  terrace method
- the first square first row first non zero label can be 1.

b = c = 0
find best a then best d/e
