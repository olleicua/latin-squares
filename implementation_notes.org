- The lib directory contains modular code that can be used by
  various programs

	- squares.c and squares.h define an interface to a latin_grid
      struct that represents a latin square of some order.  There are
      functions to measure the various metrics and print out reports
      on a pair of squares.

	- backtrack.c defines a shell of a backtracking search program.
      all of the details that might be specific to a given search
      method are left in undefined function stubs.
	
	- cyclic.c, dihedral.c, and generating_arrays.c all contain code
      specific to manipulating directed terraces and generating
      arrays.
	  
	- read_row_complete.c builds an API for reading squares from files
	  
- the row_complete_squares directory contains row complete squares
  that can be searched using the row permutations method
  
- searches contains code for the individual methods
